# GitShelf

GitShelf is a dynamic portfolio builder that leverages your GitHub username to automatically generate a personalized portfolio website. By fetching publicly available GitHub data, it allows you to selectively showcase your repositories, add detailed project descriptions, customize your "About Me" section, and provide your contact information — all within an intuitive interface. Once you’ve tailored your portfolio, GitShelf lets you export it as a standalone, portable HTML file that you can easily share or host anywhere.
